<h1>Hey there, I’m Roseline!</h1>
<p>
  I'm a UI/UX Designer and a Web Developer. </p>
  <p>
  I’ve always admired how thoughtful design and programming has the power to change our world, whether it’s through simplifying one interaction or allowing users to view things through a new lens.
  </p>
  <p>I'm a self-taught designer, programmer and have learned lots of the processes, concepts, and theories of UX/UI design through watching videos, reading blogs, and using these to create meaningful live digital experiences using creative problem-solving and a human-centered design approach.</p>
  
  I'm constantly learning new things every day and I enjoy getting to know people who have unique perspectives on the world and aren't hesitant to share them with others.
